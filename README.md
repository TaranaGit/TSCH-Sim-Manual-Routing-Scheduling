# TSCH-Sim-Manual-Routing-Scheduling

Time Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) has become prominent for low-power industrial IoT applications where primary requirements are high throughput and low delay. This project presents enhancements to the TSCH-Sim simulator that support the manual specification of a TSCH schedule and static routing for a wireless sensor network. This feature is extremely valuable for researchers that are investigating optimized scheduling for TSCH and our is not currently supported in any of the open-source TSCH simulators. TSCH-Sim is one of a few open and free simulators available that researchers can leverage to design and test any novel TSCH scheduling and routing algorithms. The additional modules have been tested and validated on the simple network where the TSCH schedule can be easily specified as well as on a more complex network with an optimized TSCH schedule. The results show that the manual TSCH schedules deliver 100\% of the generated packets under ideal conditions where there is no loss of data caused by path signal degradation. These results validate that these new modules are operating properly.
